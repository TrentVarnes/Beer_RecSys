## Overview and Motivation

BeerAdvocate has a global list of ratings for various types of beer. We aimed to build a recommendation system for them based on the data available on their website. We want to build a system that will give good recommendation regardless of the sparcity of data available on users or beers. For this we anticipate building a few different systems and working combine them all into one robust RecSys.
